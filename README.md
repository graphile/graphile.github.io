# The https://graphile.org/ website for PostGraphile and Graphile Engine

## Building

yarn run develop
```

## View in Browser

## Troubleshooting

Gatsby sometimes goes wrong/gets confused. First port of call is to kill it,
then clear the `.cache` and `public` folders:

```bash
rm -Rf .cache public
```

Requires Node version 14

```bash
nvm use 14
```

If you are running Windows and encounter an error installing `fsevents`, then
try:

```bash
yarn install --ignore-optional --force
```
