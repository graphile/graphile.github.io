Benjie travelled to [GraphQL Finland](https://graphql-finland.fi/2018/) to give
a talk on Database-Driven GraphQL Development. Learn how a database-centric
approach to GraphQL API development can give your engineers more time to focus
on the important parts of your application. Topics covered included
authorization, adhering to GraphQL best practices, embracing the power of
PostgreSQL, and avoiding common pitfalls.
