Benjie and Jem travelled to Prague for ReactiveConf where Benjie gave the
keynote on increasing velocity with GraphQL and Postgres. The talk focused on
how the two tools can pair beautifully, leading to massively increased software
development and delivery speed, faster APIs, fewer bugs and ultimately enabling
a greater focus on delivering value on the frontend rather than maintaining
three different layers of data models and associated logic on the backend.
