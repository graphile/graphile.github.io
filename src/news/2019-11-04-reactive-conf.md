Benjie and Jem travelled to Prague for [ReactiveConf](https://reactiveconf.com/)
where Benjie gave the keynote on increasing velocity with GraphQL and Postgres.
The talk focused on how the two tools can pair beautifully, leading to massively
increased software development and delivery speed, faster APIs, fewer bugs and
ultimately enabling a greater focus on delivering value on the frontend rather
than maintaining three different layers of data models and associated logic on
the backend.
