Benjie and Jem are excited to be representing the Graphile suite of tools at
this years FOSDEM in Brussels. FOSDEM is Europe's largest community conference
focussed on Open Source software, providing software developers and communities
a place to meet, get in touch with other developers, find out about the latest
developments in the free software world and attend talks and presentations on
various topics from project leaders. The team had an amazing experience at
FOSDEM in 2019 and are looking forward to meeting thousands of members of the
open source community again. [Send us a message](https://discord.org/graphile)
if you are going so we can arrange to meet!
