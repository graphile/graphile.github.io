Benjie and Jem are excited to be representing the Graphile suite of tools at
this years FOSDEM in Brussels. FOSDEM is Europe's largest community conference
focussed on Open Source software, providing software developers and communities
a place to meet, get in touch with other developers, find out about the latest
developments in the free software world and attend talks and presentations on

The team had an amazing experience at FOSDEM in 2019 and are looking forward to
meeting thousands of members of the open source community again.
