_Announced 2020-02-05_

<p class='intro'>
The team behind Graphile are excited to release Graphile Starter - an opinionated quick-start project for full-stack application development in React, Node.js, GraphQL and PostgreSQL. It includes the foundations of a modern web application, with a full user registration system, session management, optimised job queue, a significant amount of pre-configured tooling, tests and much more.
</p>

Graphile Starter is designed for client projects, hack days, side hustles, SaaS
projects, and many other uses we haven't even thought of yet. The boilerplate
for a React, GraphQL and Postgres stack is already there, just add your idea and
you're ready to go.

Some of the things included with the starter, ready for you to take and extend:

**Batteries included:** full user system and OAuth, AntD design framework, jest
and Cypress end-to-end testing, security, email templating and transport,
pre-configured linting and code formatting, deployment instructions, and more

**Speedy development:** easy debugging, Graphile's idempotent migration system,
job queue and server middleware ready to use, hot reloading; not to mention deep
integration with VSCode: plugin recommendations, preconfigured settings, ESLint
and Prettier integration and debugging profiles

**Type safety:** pre-configured type checking, strongly typed throughout with
TypeScript

**Best practices:** React, GraphQL, PostGraphile, Node, jest and Cypress best
practices

### Thank you Graphile Sponsors

Graphile Starter has been a labour of love, and would not be possible without
our sponsors. We have recently joined the GitHub sponsors program and that,
alongside Patreon, has been invaluable in giving us paid time to work on open
source projects. **Take Graphile Starter, go make some money, and then give
back** to help support further development on both the Starter and the Graphile
suite of tools.
