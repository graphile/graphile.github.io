<p class='intro'>
Today, Graphile Worker 0.4 has been released. This version includes
significantly enhanced performance gains, a dedicated API for queuing jobs from
TypeScript, and the ability to run jobs in parallel.
</p>

Graphile Worker is a job queue for PostgreSQL running on Node.js. It allows you
to run jobs (e.g. sending emails, performing calculations, generating PDFs, etc)
"in the background" so that your HTTP response/application code is not held up.
Worker can be used with any PostgreSQL-backed application and pairs beautifully
with [PostGraphile](/postgraphile/). You can find Worker
[on GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/worker/).

The full, technical details can be found in the
[release notes in the project repo](https://github.com/graphile/worker/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

### Thank you Graphile Sponsors

Graphile Worker is a part of a suite of open source developer tools which we
make to address both our needs as developers, and the needs of the wider
developer community. This freedom to innovate and make our tooling available for
free would not be possible without our sponsors. We have recently joined the
GitHub sponsors program and that, alongside Patreon, has been invaluable in
giving us paid time to work on open source projects. **Take our projects, go
make some money, and then give back** to help support further development on
both Worker and the whole Graphile suite of tools.
