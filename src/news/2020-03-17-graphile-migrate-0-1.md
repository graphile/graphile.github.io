_Announced 2020-03-17 by Team Graphile_

<p class='intro'>
The Graphile team are pleased to announce that Graphile Migrate 0.1 is out in pre-release. This is a big milestone for the project, with it finally leaving 0.0.x territory and leaving behind the word "highly" in the phrase "highly experimental"! This release is a significant jump from the previous versions and includes many new commands, more configuration options, as well as a suite of new features.
</p>

Graphile Migrate is an opinionated, SQL-powered, productive roll-forward
migration tool for Postgres. In true Graphile style, it is simple, familiar,
fully functional and fast: Save a file and the database is updated in
milliseconds. There's no custom DSL to learn, instead use standard Postgres
syntax. Graphile Migrate pairs well with [PostGraphile](/postgraphile/) and the
wider Graphile suite of tools. You can find it
[on GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/migrate/).
