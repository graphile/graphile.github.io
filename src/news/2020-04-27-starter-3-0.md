_Announced 2020-04-27_

<p class='intro'>
The team behind Graphile are excited to release Graphile Starter 3.0 - an updated version of the opinionated quick-start project for full-stack application development in React, Node.js, GraphQL and PostgreSQL. Starter includes the foundations of a modern web application, with a full user registration system, session management, optimised job queue, a significant amount of pre-configured tooling, tests and much more.
</p>

Version three of Graphile Starter is focused on organisation support. A Starter
organisation is a group of users (such as a charity, workspace or team) where
one user is "in charge" and one person is a billing contact; with support for
further permissions configuration. Starter 3.0 includes all the behaviours you'd
expect from such a quick start project: creating, deleting and inviting users;
inviting non-users; sending and accepting invite emails, re-assigning the
ownership or billing contact; managing members; and controlling access to
settings based on user role.

Some of the things included with Starter, ready for you to take and extend:

**Batteries included:** full user system and OAuth with support for
organisations or teams, AntD design framework, jest and Cypress end-to-end
testing, security, email templating and transport, pre-configured linting and
code formatting, deployment instructions, and more

**Speedy development:** easy debugging, Graphile's idempotent migration system,
job queue and server middleware ready to use, hot reloading; not to mention deep
integration with VSCode

**Type safety:** pre-configured type checking, strongly typed throughout with
TypeScript

**Best practices:** React, GraphQL, PostGraphile, Node, jest and Cypress best
practices

Full instructions and technical detail can be found on GitHub:

### Using Version 3.0

It is intended that you use a "point in time" version of Starter - it's a
starting point for your own projects. As such, you can't simply update your
existing Starter project to this new version as there's no attempt at backwards
compatibility.

### Thank you Graphile Sponsors

Graphile Starter has been a labour of love, and would not be possible without
our sponsors. We have recently joined the GitHub sponsors program and that,
alongside Patreon, has been invaluable in giving us paid time to work on open
source projects. **Take Graphile Starter, go make some money, and then give
back** to help support further development on both the Starter and the Graphile
suite of tools.
