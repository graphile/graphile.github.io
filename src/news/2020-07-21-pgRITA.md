Graphile are pleased to share [pgRITA](https://pgrita.com), a new tool to help

## Recommendations. Insights. Tailored. Actionable.

pgRITA analyzes your database schema against our rules, compiling an interactive
report that helps your engineers to build secure, robust and performant
databases. Many of our rules produce fixes tailored to your database enabling
you to fix missing indexes, constraints, permissions and more in record time.

## Really Insightful Technical Appliance

pgRITA compiles an interactive report showing the results of the database
analysis, with detailed documentation that explains the potential issues found
in the database, and helps engineers determine how to resolve them.

If you're thinking of engaging a database consultant, running pgRITA first could
be a great way to reduce costs â”€ enabling the consultant to focus in the more
bespoke areas where they provide the most value.
