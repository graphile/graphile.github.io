Graphile are pleased to share [pgRITA](https://pgrita.com), a new tool to help
you write performant and efficient database schemas.

## Recommendations. Insights. Tailored. Actionable.

pgRITA analyzes your database schema against our rules, compiling an interactive
report that helps your engineers to build secure, robust and performant
databases. Many of our rules produce fixes tailored to your database enabling
you to fix missing indexes, constraints, permissions and more in record time.

## Really Insightful Technical Appliance

pgRITA compiles an interactive report showing the results of the database
analysis, with detailed documentation that explains the potential issues found
in the database, and helps engineers determine how to resolve them.

If you're thinking of engaging a database consultant, running pgRITA first could
be a great way to reduce costs â”€ enabling the consultant to focus in the more
bespoke areas where they provide the most value.

pgRITA: if you've ever thought "I'd love to have the Graphile maintainer
checking over my database schema design," then we're extremely excited to share
our news with you! We've built a service (using Graphile Starter ðŸ’ª ) that will
analyze your database design against a list of rules we've compiled over the
last few years of consultancy and support, explains any detected issues, and in
many cases provides tailored SQL fixes to inspire your next migration. Income
from this service will help fund Graphile's OSS endeavours, and what's more, it
has a free plan with some essential rules that pair beautifully with
PostGraphile. Sign up today, no credit card necessary: https://pgrita.com/
