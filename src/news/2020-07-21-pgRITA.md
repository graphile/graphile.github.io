<p class="intro">
If you've ever thought "I'd love to have the Graphile maintainer
checking over my database schema design," then we're extremely excited to share
our news with you!</p>

We've built a service (using Graphile Starter) that will analyze your database
design against a list of rules we've compiled over the last few years of
consultancy and support, explains any detected issues, and in many cases
provides tailored SQL fixes to inspire your next migration. Income from this
service will help fund Graphile's Open Source endeavours, and what's more, it
has a free plan with some essential rules that pair beautifully with
PostGraphile.

### Recommendations. Insights. Tailored. Actionable.

pgRITA analyzes your database schema against our rules, compiling an interactive
report that helps your engineers to build secure, robust and performant
databases. Many of our rules produce fixes tailored to your database enabling
you to fix missing indexes, constraints, permissions and more in record time.

### Really Insightful Technical Appliance

pgRITA compiles an interactive report showing the results of the database
analysis, with detailed documentation that explains the potential issues found
in the database, and helps engineers determine how to resolve them.

If you're thinking of engaging a database consultant, running pgRITA first could
be a great way to reduce costs â”€ enabling the consultant to focus in the more
bespoke areas where they provide the most value.
