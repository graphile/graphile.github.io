Graphile Migrate has proven itself stable; so it's finally time to bump it to v1
ðŸŽ‰

Graphile Migrate is an opinionated SQL-powered productive roll-forward migration
tool for PostgreSQL.

Why?

    fast iteration speed â€” save a file and database is updated in milliseconds
    roll-forward only â€” maintaining rollbacks is a chore, and in 10 years of API development I've never ran one in production
    familiar â€” no custom DSL to learn, just use PostgreSQL syntax
    fully functional â€” sending SQL commands directly to PostgreSQL means you can use all of PostgreSQL's features
    complements PostGraphile â€” works with any application, but PostGraphile's watch mode means that the GraphQL schema is instantly regenerated (without server restart) whenever the database changes
