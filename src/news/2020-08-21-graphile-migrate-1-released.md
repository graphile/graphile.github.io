<p class='intro'>
The Graphile team are pleased to announce that Graphile Migrate 1.0  has been released; after many months of use and testing, Migrate is ready to move from 'experimental' into stable v1.0.0. There are no breaking changes in this release, there is now support for a .gmrc.js file and a few minor fixes.

Graphile Migrate is an opinionated, SQL-powered, productive roll-forward
migration tool for Postgres. In true Graphile style, it is simple, familiar,
fully functional, configurable and fast: Save a file and the database is updated
in milliseconds. There's no custom DSL to learn, use already familiar Postgres
syntax. Graphile Migrate pairs well with [PostGraphile](/postgraphile/) and the
wider Graphile suite of tools. You can find it
[on GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/migrate/).
