This week, Benjie was profiled by the
[GitHub ReadME project](https://github.com/readme), a new endevour to collect
stories from open source maintainers and amplify their voices to the wider
developer community.

[Click through to the ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme/stories/benjie-gillam)
to read Benjie's history of software development, starting as a teenager at the
turn of the millennium with his own Linux mail server in his bedroom. As he
entered the world of employment, he realised he much preferred the freedom of
running his own business gave him, and eventually incorporated Graphile with his
wife Jem in 2019. Together, they work on Graphile's open source projects and are
seeking funding through GitHub Sponsors and Patreon.

In this article, Benjie discusses the ins-and-outs of running an open source
company with his wife, while building a supportive community, and sheds light on
how other maintainers may start to take their passion project full time.
