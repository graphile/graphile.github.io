This week, Benjie was profiled by the
[GitHub ReadME project](https://github.com/readme), a new endeavour to collect
stories from open source maintainers and amplify their voices to the wider
developer community.

[Click through to the ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme/stories/benjie-gillam)
to read Benjie's history of software development, starting as a teenager at the
turn of the millennium with his own Linux mail server in his bedroom. As he
entered the world of employment, he realised he much preferred the freedom of
running his own business gave him, and eventually incorporated Graphile with his
wife Jem in 2019. Together, they work on Graphile's open source projects and are
seeking funding through GitHub Sponsors and Patreon.

In this article, Benjie discusses the ins-and-outs of running an open source
company with his wife, while building a supportive community, and sheds light on
how other maintainers may start to take their passion project full time.

Benjie and Jem enjoy working together in open source, and this wouldn't be
possible without the sponsorship from the community. By significantly reducing
the amount of work needed to achieve business goals, using the Graphile tools
results in huge savings for users. If your organization contributes some of
these savings back then everyone can benefit from more frequent releases with
better performance, better compatibility, better documentation, easier
customization, and more features — leading to even greater savings or profits
for your organization.
