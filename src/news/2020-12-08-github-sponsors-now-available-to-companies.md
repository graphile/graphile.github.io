GitHub Sponsors is now available to companies. Many companies depend on open
source every day, so it's crucial to invest back into that infrastructure which
they have built their businesses upon. So starting today, companies can sponsor
projects and developers through their existing billing with GitHub.

Sponsoring Graphile to pursue improvements that benefit all parties in the
ecosystem, ensures the software remains relevant and something you'll be able to
rely on for years to come.
