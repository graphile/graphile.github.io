<p class="intro">Many companies depend on open source every day, so it's crucial to invest back into that infrastructure which they have built their businesses upon. So starting today, companies can sponsor projects and developers through their existing billing with GitHub.</p>

Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under the
permissive MIT license, including PostGraphile, Graphile Worker, Graphile
Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases the rate of fixes,
documentation improvements, and feature development on these and other projects.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals,
using the Graphile tools results in huge savings for users. If your organization
contributes some of these savings back then everyone can benefit from more
frequent releases with better performance, better compatibility, better
documentation, easier customization, and more features â€” leading to even greater
savings or profits for your organization.
