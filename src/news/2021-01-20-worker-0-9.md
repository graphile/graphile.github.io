<p class='intro'>
Graphile is pleased to announce the release of version 0.9 -  
</p>

    New (experimental) "cron" functionality for regularly scheduled jobs
    Replace jobs ordering index for improved performance (thanks @ben-pr-p)
        NOTE: this migration might take a moment if you have a large jobs table
    New events system lets you monitor what's going on inside Graphile Worker
    New job_key_mode setting; see README for full details, but summary:
        defaults to replace (existing behavior, i.e. debouncing)
        if set to preserve_run_at it will preserve run_at which effectively changes it from debouncing to throttling
        if set to unsafe_dedupe it will not update the attributes when an existing job with that job key exists, even if that job is already running
    remove_job now prevents locked jobs from running again on error (and removes their key)
    Dependency updates

## New `job_key_mode` setting

https://github.com/graphile/worker/tree/v0.9.0#replacing-updating-and-removing-jobs

job_key_mode - when job_key is specified, this setting indicates what should
happen when an existing job is found with the same job key:

    replace (default) - all job parameters are updated to the new values, including the run_at (inserts new job if matching job is locked)
    preserve_run_at - all job parameters are updated to the new values, except for run_at which maintains the previous value (inserts new job if matching job is locked)
    unsafe_dedupe - only inserts the job if no existing job (whether or not it is locked or has failed permanently) with matching key is found; does not update the existing job
