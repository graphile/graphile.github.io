_Announced 2021-01-20 by the Graphile Team_

<p class='intro'>
Today, Graphile Worker 0.9 has been released. This version includes
a new events system, a new cron functionality for regularly scheduled jobs and a new job_key_mode setting.
</p>

Graphile Worker is a job queue for PostgreSQL running on Node.js. It allows you
to run jobs (e.g. sending emails, performing calculations, generating PDFs, etc)
"in the background" so that your HTTP response/application code is not held up.
Worker can be used with any PostgreSQL-backed application and pairs beautifully
with [PostGraphile](/postgraphile/). You can find Worker
[on GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/worker/).

### New `job_key_mode` setting

When `job_key` is specified, the `job_key_mode` setting indicates what should
happen when an existing job is found with the same job key. By default the
existing job is replaced, but you can also choose to update to the new
attributes, or stop and return the existing job. There's more information in
[the project readme](https://github.com/graphile/worker/tree/v0.9.0#replacing-updating-and-removing-jobs).

### Thank you Graphile Sponsors

Graphile Worker is a part of a suite of open source developer tools which we
make to address both our needs as developers, and the needs of the wider
developer community. This freedom to innovate and make our tooling available for
free would not be possible without our sponsors. We have recently joined the
GitHub sponsors program and that, alongside Patreon, has been invaluable in
giving us paid time to work on open source projects. **Take our projects, go
make some money, and then give back** to help support further development on
both Worker and the whole Graphile suite of tools.
