_Announced 2021-05-27 by the Graphile Team_

<p class='intro'>
Graphile is pleased to announce the release of PostGraphile version 4.12 - a significant update bringing full support for aggregates. 
</p>

### Awesome Aggregates

We've finally taken our proof of concept aggregation plugin and fleshed it out
with some very significant features: calculating aggregates across connections,
grouped aggregates, applying conditions to grouped aggregates, ordering by
relational aggregates, filtering by the results of aggregates on related
connections, and more besides.

For more details
[see the plugin hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/pg-aggregates)
