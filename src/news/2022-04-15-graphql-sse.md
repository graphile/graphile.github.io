PostGraphile now supports GraphQL over Server-Sent Events (SSE) powered by
`graphql-sse`! `graphql-sse` is a zero-dependency, HTTP/1 safe, simple, GraphQL
over Server-Sent Events Protocol server and client, written by Denis Badurina.
Find his implementation for PostGraphile in the
[graphile-contrib repo](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/graphql-sse).
