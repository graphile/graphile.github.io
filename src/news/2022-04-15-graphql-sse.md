<p class='intro'>
PostGraphile now supports GraphQL over Server-Sent Events; a protocol which
enables the user to push data to web pages in real-time.
</p>

This functionality is powered by `graphql-sse` - a zero-dependency, HTTP/1 safe,
simple, GraphQL over Server-Sent Events Protocol server and client, written by
Denis Badurina.

Find his implementation for PostGraphile in the
[graphile-contrib repo](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/graphql-sse).

This is just one example of a Graphile community member adding to the Graphile
suite of open source tools. We welcome contributions in many forms across many
of our projects, from simple fixes in our documentation through to community
plug-ins and contributions to the main PostGraphile git branch. If you wish to
get involved, a good first step is our [Contribution Guide](/contribute/); if
you wish to get stuck into developing on the main branches of our projects then
please pop into our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile) where we
have several `#dev` channels - this will let you see where we're currently
working in the code base, and ideas others have also had. Pull requests should
be focused on changing only one thing at a time - and large changes should seek
maintainer approval first. We look forward to welcoming you to our team of
contributors!
