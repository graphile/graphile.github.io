This week, Benjie gave a virtual talk at
[GraphQL Conf](https://graphql.org/foundation/graphql-conf/) - the first
official GraphQL Conference hosted by the GraphQL Foundation.

Benjie was one of eight GraphQL experts giving a talk on the cutting edge of
GraphQL advancements; his talk focused on the need for a defined approach to
GraphQL schema metadata. From complex challenges such as federating schemas to
simply indicating pagination limits, the needs for this metadata are growing.
This talk surfaced some of the use cases for schema metadata, looked over some
of the workarounds that are in use, and briefly explored some proposed
solutions.
