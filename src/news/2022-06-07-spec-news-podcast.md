<p class="intro">Benjie and Jem are pleased to announce the release of new podcast
SpecNews! A monthly round up of GraphQL Specification news in under ten minutes.</p>

Benjie is a GraphQL TSC member and attends the monthly working groups, he then
gives Jem a digest of the two or three hour meeting. He figured, why not make
that digest available for everyone?
