Benjie and Jem are pleased to announce the release of new podcast
[Spec News](https://specnewspod.com)! A monthly round up of GraphQL Spec news in
under ten minutes.

Benjie is a GraphQL TSC member and attends the monthly working groups, he then
gives Jem a digest of the two or three hour meeting. He figured, why not make
that digest available for everyone?

The podcast is available on
