This week, Jem took part in the
[GitHub ReadME project](https://github.com/readme), an endevour to collect
stories from open source maintainers and amplify their voices to the wider
developer community. The project contains many articles, educatonal material and
podcasts all focused on the developer commuinity.

[Click through to the ReadME Project](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-what-to-do-when-your-open-source-project-becomes-a-community/)
to read a panel interview with Jem alongside
[Chrissy LeMaire](https://tech.lgbt/@cl), the creator and maintainer of
[dbatools](https://dbatools.io/), and
[Fred Schott](http://fredkschott.com/about/), the co-creator of
[Astro](https://astro.build/).

In this article, Jem discusses how they helped to build the community around
Graphile, beginning with the early days of PostGraphile and the growing
realisation that users wanted an online space to come together to craft plugins
and discuss different approaches of Postgres and GraphQL. When the first
donations to the project began coming in, they realised it was time to become
more intentional in their approach to community building and began drawing
inspiration from other open source projects.
