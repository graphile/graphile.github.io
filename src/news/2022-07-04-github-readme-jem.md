<p class="intro">This week, Jem took part in the
GitHub ReadME project, an endeavour to collect
stories from open source maintainers and amplify their voices to the wider
developer community. The project contains many articles, educational material
and podcasts all focused on the developer community.</p>

[Click through to the ReadME Project](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-what-to-do-when-your-open-source-project-becomes-a-community/)
to read a panel interview with Jem alongside
[Chrissy LeMaire](https://tech.lgbt/@cl), the creator and maintainer of
[dbatools](https://dbatools.io/), and
[Fred Schott](http://fredkschott.com/about/), the co-creator of
[Astro](https://astro.build/).

In this article, Jem discusses how they helped to build the community around
Graphile, beginning with the early days of PostGraphile and the growing
realization that users wanted an online space to come together to craft plugins
and discuss different approaches of Postgres and GraphQL. When the first
donations to the project began coming in, they realized it was time to become
more intentional in their approach to community building and began drawing
inspiration from other open source projects.

Benjie and Jem enjoy working together in open source, and this wouldn't be
possible without the sponsorship from the community. By significantly reducing
the amount of work needed to achieve business goals, using the Graphile tools
results in huge savings for users. If your organization contributes some of
these savings back then everyone can benefit from more frequent releases with
better performance, better compatibility, better documentation, easier
customization, and more features â€” leading to even greater savings or profits
for your organization.
