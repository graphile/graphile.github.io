_Announced 2022-10-11 by the Graphile Team_

<p class='intro'>
Graphile are pleased to announce the release of Graphile Worker 0.14, which
includes many new significant changes in preparation for moving towards version
1.0.

### Batch Jobs

Normally a job's `payload` is an object; however jobs are also allowed to have a
`payload` which is an array of objects. Jobs of this type are called "batch
jobs" and they have a few special behaviours:

- when you use `job_key` in `replace` or `preserve_run_at` mode, when a job is
  replaced/updated, instead of overwriting the payload, the existing and new
  payloads will be merged into a larger array (this only occurs when the
  existing and new payloads are both arrays, otherwise the payload is simply
  replaced).
- when a task executes a batch job, it may return a list of promises that is the
  same length as the payload array. If any of these promises reject, then the
  job is said to have 'partial success', the result of which is it being sent
  back to the queue for a retry, but with the successful objects removed from
  the payload so only the failed objects will be retried.

Batch jobs can be useful where you need to aggregate multiple tasks together
over time for efficiency; for example if you have a notification system you
might schedule a notification to be sent to a user in 2 minutes time that they
received a DM. Over the next 2 minutes if any other DMs are received, these can
be appended to the job payload such that when the job executes it can inform the
user of all of these DMs, not just the latest one.

### Other Features

- Significantly improved 'large jobs table' performance (e.g. when a large queue
  is locked, or there's a lot of jobs queued for task identifiers your worker
  instance doesn't support, or a lot of failed jobs). There's around 20x
  improvement in this 'worst case' performance for real user workloads.
- Added new (experimental) much faster `add_jobs` batch API.
- Fix error handling of cron issues in 'run' method.
- `CronItem.match` can now accept either a pattern string or a matcher function.
