This week at [GraphQL Galaxy](https://graphqlgalaxy.com/), Benjie introduced his
vision for a new general-purpose GraphQL execution strategy whose holistic
approach could lead to significant efficiency and scalability gains for all
GraphQL APIs. This talk is the first public look at the ludicrously speedy,
general purpose and holistic advanced planning and execution engine codenamed
Grafast.
