<p class='intro'>
In our new blog post series, we are beginning to lift the curtain of secrecy which has surrounded Version 5 for the past few years. Each week, Benjie will dive in to a key feature of this massive new release.
</p>

This week we are starting with an exploration of replacing the look-ahead
system. In the post, you&apos;ll find out why we invented
[Gra<em>fast</em>](/news/20221208-graphql-galaxy/) (our new planning and
execution engine for GraphQL); see examples of the straightforward &ldquo;plan
resolvers&rdquo; that PostGraphile V5 uses; and revel in the significantly
simplified and more efficient SQL queries that V5 generates.

### PostGraphile V5 Sponsors Early Access

April marked a big milestone for PostGraphile Version 5, when
[it entered the alpha stage](https://postgraphile.org/news/2023-04-26-version-5-alpha).

With thanks to everyone in the V5 testing community - and a special shout out
for the excellent and continued feedback from our sponsors dfg, hov, James,
Josiah and the Netflix team, mattste, Simon, and Timo - **we're now confident V5
is suitable to run in production**. Work preparing for final release is still
ongoing, but we now have a
[detailed migration guide](https://postgraphile.org/postgraphile/next/migrating-from-v4/),
[updated docs](https://postgraphile.org), an enhanced developer experience and
much improved backwards compatibility!

With the beta just around the corner, now is the perfect time to join our
sponsors and test Version 5. **If you don’t try V5 until after its public
release then it may be too late to comment on things that could have been
improved**. All sponsors are invited to join the early access program, if you
already sponsor us please get in contact and we'll arrange an access code for
you and your team.

### Thank you for sponsoring the project!

Our ability to innovate and make our tooling freely available would not be
possible without our sponsors, thank you to each and every sponsor - past and
present - for the financial support to keep building tools which serve you.
