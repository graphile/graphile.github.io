It’s finally here! The day has come that you can get your hands on an early
  release of PostGraphile Version 5; but we do have an ask: please help us to
  get it ready for release.

We need help writing automated tests, validating it works in your real-world
applications, improving the documentation, keeping up with issues and community
support, porting plugins, smoothing edges, and as always we need financial
support so we can keep investing our time into V5 and our other projects. Find
out what this means for you at the new
