_Announced 2025-06-04 by the Graphile Team_

<p class='intro'>
In the first Gra<em>fast</em> Working Group, we outlined 4 <em>major</em> issues in Gra<em>fast</em>
  that needed to be addressed before we could think about general release. With
  this release, 3 of these are now complete! sdfjkslkdf sdf klsjdflk jssdf sdf sdf ds  sdgsdfsdf ggg
</p>

- ✅ Global dependencies - solved via "unary" steps
- ✅ Early exit - solved via "flags"
- ✅ Eradicating eval
- ✅ **Polymorphism - this release!**

After 3 months of gruelling work, we're proud to announce that the third of
these, eradicating eval, is now addressed with the launch of
`grafast@0.1.1-beta.21` (used as the core execution engine in
`postgraphile@5.0.0-beta.39`). Let's look into what that has meant.
