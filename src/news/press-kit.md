title: About PostGraphile and Graphile Engine
---

PostGraphile helps developers expose the powerful next generation features of
PostgreSQL as an extensible GraphQL API. Developers can use their existing
PostgreSQL knowledge to build secure and highly performant GraphQL APIs in
record time, without having to learn a complex new toolkit, and without lock-in.
The powerful Graphile Engine plugin system enables developers to add
functionality to their API without compromising performance and latency, leading
to incredibly smooth experiences for their customers - even on mobile. The
growing ecosystem of plugins and reliance on familiar PostgreSQL enables
developers to get a prototype up and running in minutes.

### PostGraphile and Graphile Engine logos

The Graphile Engine logo is a red angular heart, inspired by the edges in a
GraphQL API.  
The PostGraphile logo is a fierce blue elephant, combining elements from
Graphile Engine's heart and PostgreSQL's elephant logo.
