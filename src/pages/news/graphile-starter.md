_Announced 2019-12-03_

<p class='intro'>
The team behind Graphile are excited to release Graphile Starter - an opinionated quick-start project for full-stack application development in React, Node.js, GraphQL and PostgreSQL. It includes the foundations of a modern web application, with a full user registration system, session management, optimised job queue, a significant amount of pre-configured tooling, tests and much more.
</p>

Graphile Starter is designed for client projects, hack days, side hustles, SaaS projects, and many other uses we haven't even thought of yet. The boilerplate for a React, GraphQL and Postgres stack is already there, just add your idea and you're ready to go.

Some of the things included with the starter, ready for you to take and extend:

**Batteries included:** full user system and OAuth, AntD design framework, jest and Cypress end-to-end testing, security, email templating and transport, pre-configured linting and code formatting, deployment instructions, and more

**Speedy development:** easy debugging, Graphile's idempotent migration system, job queue and server middleware ready to use, hot reloading; not to mention deep integration with VSCode: plugin recommendations, preconfigured settings, ESLint and Prettier integration and debugging profiles

**Type safety:** pre-configured type checking, strongly typed throughout with TypeScript

**Best practices:** React, GraphQL, PostGraphile, Node, jest and Cypress best practices

### Thank you Graphile Sponsors

Graphile Starter has been a labour of love, and would not be possible without our sponsors. We have recently joined the GitHub sponsors program and that, alongside Patreon, has been invaluable in giving us paid time to work on open source projects. **Take Graphile Starter, go make some money, and then give back** to help support further development on both the Starter and the Graphile suite of tools.
