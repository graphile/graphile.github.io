Out of the box, PostGraphile supports rudimentary filtering on
[connections](/postgraphile/connections/) using a `condition` argument. This
allows you to filter for specific values (e.g. `username: "Alice"` or
`category: ARTICLE`).

It's important when implementing filters to keep performance in mind, so
PostGraphile gives you the ability to omit certain fields from the list of
filters using the `@omit filter` [smart comment](/postgraphile/smart-comments/).
You may also use the `--no-ignore-indexes` option to try and automatically omit
fields that don't appear to be indexed.

### Advanced filtering

You can extend PostGraphile's schema with more advance filtering capabilities by
adding fields using [custom queries](/postgraphile/custom-queries/),
[computed columns](/postgraphile/computed-columns/) or by using
[makeExtendSchemaPlugin](/postgraphile/make-extend-schema-plugin/).

You can also augment PostGraphile's existing connections using custom
[Graphile Engine plugins](/postgraphile/extending-raw/), such as:

#### Filter Plugin

A very popular plugin is Matt Bretl's connection-filter plugin, located at
[https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter).
This adds a `filter` argument to connections that enables you to use advanced
filters, including filtering on related records from other tables, using greater
than, less than and ranges for filtering, and even filtering against the output
of functions. If you need advanced filtering in your GraphQL API (and you can
use something like
[persisted queries](/postgraphile/production/#simple-query-whitelist-persisted-queries)
to prevent malicious parties issuing complex requests) then I recommend you
check it out!

Be aware that the connection-filter plugin has no live-query specific handling.
This means while [live queries](/postgraphile/live-queries/) will work, the
filters are not taken into account when checking if the query result changed.
This means that you may get a subscription update every time something in the
collection changes, even if the result with the applied filter is still the
same.

With the included `condition` filters live queries work as expected until you
start using [makeAddPgTableConditionPlugin](/postgraphile/make-add-pg-table-condition-plugin/) to add your own conditions.

#### Other plugins

Some more of the community plugins relate to filtering, you can read more about
them on the [community plugins page](/postgraphile/community-plugins/)
