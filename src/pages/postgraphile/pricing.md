### How to get Pro

PostGraphile Pro is available as a perk for
[Graphile sponsors](https://graphile.org/sponsor/). Businesses which use
PostGraphile should explore sponsorship as the first option to obtain Pro, as
sponsorship also helps to fund development and maintenance of the Graphile
suite, as well as enabling us to advance the software they rely on.

For businesses which are not capable of engaging in the sponsorship model, there
is an option to purchase the license by itself. However, this does not come with
any other benefit such as priority support or discounted consultancy rates.

##### <sup>‡</sup> These features integrate deeply with PostGraphile and have been optimised for its nuances by the maintainer. If you wish to build and maintain protections yourself rather than using the Pro plugin, refer to [Running in Production](/postgraphile/production/) for information on how you might go about doing this. Purchasing the Pro plugin helps fund ongoing development and maintenance on the open source PostGraphile project.

### PostGraphile V4 Core and PostGraphile V5 are OSS under the MIT license

PostGraphile V4 Core is sufficient for many peoples needs; it's the only version
that existed for the first 2 years of the project and many people are running it
with great success in production. No features in PostGraphile V4 Core have been
removed or obscured, and it continues to be maintained. PostGraphile V5 is also
open source under the MIT License and continues to be advanced and enhanced.

Development and maintenance of PostGraphile V5 is ongoing, supported by
contributions from the community, [professional services](/support/) contracts
and [GitHub Sponsors](/sponsor/).

### PostGraphile Pro is a commercial plugin for those who wish to scale with PostGraphile V4

The Pro plugin enhances PostGraphile with additional features and is loaded
through the standard [server plugin interface](/postgraphile/plugins/).

The Pro plugin contains features that are particularly useful to businesses
wishing to scale their solution out using database read-replicas or protect the
generated GraphQL API from expensive queries which may be issued by untrusted
third parties. (Typically if the intended clients to your GraphQL API are
first-party only then you would use a GraphQL query allowlist (e.g. persisted
queries) for this purpose; although the Pro features can still be helpful to
dissuade your developers from building expensive queries!)

### Does the license cover my production cluster?

The [Pro plugin EULA](https://store.graphile.com/eulas/postgraphile-pro/) states
you may:

> use up to four Production Instances and up to 100 Development Instances of the
> Software

This is enough to cover a small cluster of 4 PostGraphile servers. If you will
be running a larger cluster than this, please
[get in touch](mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Large%20cluster) for custom
licensing.

### How many licenses do I need to cover my multiple development/testing stages?

The [Pro plugin EULA](https://store.graphile.com/eulas/postgraphile-pro/) states
you may:

> use up to four Production Instances and up to 100 Development Instances of the
> Software

"Development Instance" is defined as "an Instance that is used to support
development, testing or deployment of a Production Instance", which covers
standard development, staging, QA and similar environments.

If you have larger needs than this, please
[get in touch](mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Large%20cluster) for custom
licensing.

### Where are the @graphile/pro docs/changelog?

You can read the
[@graphile/pro README on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphile/pro).
There's also a lot more information in the
[Production Considerations](/postgraphile/production/) page on this website.

### Is the fulfillment of the license key automated?

Yes, license keys are issued automatically by our store software upon completion
of the payment process. Sponsors can use their GitHub Sponsors account to log in
to the store.

### Do license keys "phone home"?

No, license keys are static and contain all the necessary claims, not dissimilar
to JWTs. Our software does not "phone home."

You are not permitted to use the software once the EULA terminates (e.g. if you
stop paying). We trust you, and want to minimise your maintenance burden, so the
automated keys expire after one year rather than one month. You will be able to
issue new keys via the store when your key is near to expiry. Please do not
abuse our trust.

### Does the Pro License come with direct support?

No. We run community support through our
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/graphile) where anyone can ask and answer
questions about PostGraphile and the Graphile suite of tools. Sponsors receive
priority support from our maintainers within our Discord Server. Sponsors on the
"Private Advisor" tier or above can enter a complimentary Development Support
contract and receive support through their company Slack/GitHub organization.
Prices start at \$1,500 a month, with no minimum term. More information can be
found at the [Development Support page](https://graphile.org/support/) or you
can
[get in contract](mailto:info@graphile.org?subject=Private%20Advisor%20tier%20question).

### I'm an enterprise user and need X, Y and Z

Please [get in touch](mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Enterprise%20enquiry) and
we'll be happy to help!
