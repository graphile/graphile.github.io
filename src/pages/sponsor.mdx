<h3>
  Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under
  the permissive MIT license, including PostGraphile, Graphile Worker,
  Graphile Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases the rate of
  fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development on these and
  other projects.

Gra<em>fast</em> and PostGraphile Version 5 are now in open beta thanks in large
part to the support given through sponsorship.

Sponsorship is the most effective way to support our open source projects
&mdash; it enables us to invest time directly into their maintenance and
advancement without adding additional time burdens.

### Why "crowd-funded open-source project"?

Many of our projects are open-source to give users great freedom in how they use
the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the
projects progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To
ensure users can rely on these projects for years to come, they need to be well
directed and financially sustainable.

**The absolute best way to support Graphile is to become a sponsor.**
Crowd-sourced funding enables us to spend the most time directly working on
improving the software, which you and other users then benefit from.

### How is sponsorship money spent?

Sponsorship money is used to fund software development, testing, documentation
and releases of PostGraphile and the Graphile suite. A small amount is also used
to send rewards such as stickers and learning materials to our backers.

### Is sponsorship required to use Graphile's OSS?

Users are not legally required to give back to the Graphile project, but it is
in their interest to do so.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals
and reducing running costs, Graphile's software results in huge time and money
savings for users. We encourage organizations to contribute a portion of these
savings back, enabling the projects to advance more rapidly, and result in even
greater savings for your organization.

### How can I sponsor?

Our preferred sponsorship provider is currently GitHub since they are waiving
all fees:

team@graphile, or DM Benjie or Jem [on Discord](http://discord.gg/graphile).
