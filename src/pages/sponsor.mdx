<h3>
  Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under
  the permissive MIT license, including PostGraphile, Graphile Worker,
  Graphile Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases the rate of
  fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development on these and
  other projects.

Gra<em>fast</em> and PostGraphile Version 5 are now in open beta thanks in large
part to the support given through sponsorship.

Sponsorship is the most effective way to support our open source projects
&mdash; it enables us to invest time directly into their maintenance and
advancement without adding additional time burdens.

### Why “crowd-funded open-source project”?

Many of our projects are open-source to give users great freedom in how they use
the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the
projects progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To
ensure users can rely on these projects for years to come, they need to be well
directed and financially sustainable.

**The best way to ensure that Graphile software is something you can depend on for years
to come is through monthly sponsorship.** Crowd-sourced funding enables us to spend the 
most time directly working on improving the software, which you and other users then benefit from.

### Sponsor tiers and benefits

As well as ensuring the sustainability and longevity of PostGraphile and the wider Graphile
suite of developer tooling, sponsorship also gives you or your company some additional benefits
such as access to security announcements and being featured in the README files of Graphile’s
main open source projects. Choose the tier which matches your funding goal, higher tiers come
with more benefits.

### How is sponsorship money spent?

Sponsorship money is used to fund software development, testing, documentation
and releases of PostGraphile and the Graphile suite. A small amount is also used
to send rewards such as stickers and learning materials to our backers.

### Is sponsorship required to use Graphile’s OSS?

Users are not legally required to give back to the Graphile project, but it is
in their interest to do so.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals
and reducing running costs, Graphile's software results in huge time and money
savings for users. We encourage organizations to contribute a portion of these
savings back, enabling the projects to advance more rapidly, and result in even
greater savings for your organization.
