### Why "crowd-funded open-source project"?

Many of our projects are open-source to give users great freedom in how they
use the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the
projects progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To
ensure users can rely on these projects for years to come, they need to
be well directed and financially sustainable.

**The absolute best way to support Graphile
is to become a sponsor.** Crowd-sourced funding enables us to spend the most
time directly working on improving the software, which you and other
users then benefit from.

### How is sponsorship money spent?

Sponsorship money is used to fund software development, testing,
documentation and releases of the PostGraphile and Graphile suite. A small
amount is also used to send rewards such as stickers and learning materials
to our backers.

### Is sponsorship required to use Graphile's OSS?

Users are not legally required to give back to the Graphile project, but
it is in their interest to do so.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals
and reducing running costs, Graphile's software results in huge time and money
savings for users. We encourage organizations to contribute a portion of
these savings back, enabling the projects to advance more rapidly, and result
in even greater savings for your organization.
