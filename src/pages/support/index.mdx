## FAQ

### Does the support plan cover large/complex deployments, and multi-stage QA pipelines?

The advertised fee is not affected by how you deploy, or how many development
environments you have. However, you should note that the support plan
covers issues with the Graphile suite only, it does not cover external concerns such as
your servers, routing, proxying and deployment â€” we cannot help you debug your
Kubernetes cluster, or help spot an issue in your nginx config.

### What kind of things can the support be used for?

The main use case for Graphile support is that if you hit a bug in
PostGraphile or the Graphile suite of tools, we can help you to understand it, and advise you on how to work
around the issue until a fix is available. Given PostGraphile's MIT license
(which disclaims all liabilities), having the guarantee of a rapid response
to production or development issues is the main value proposition of the
support plan.

A secondary use case is if the documentation is unclear or
lacking in a particular area, we can prioritise fixing it, and can provide
you with a solution/explanation in the interim.

Experimental features of PostGraphile (these are marked with 'experimental'
or 'EXPERIMENTAL' in the documentation) are not officially covered under the
support agreement, but if we're able we will try and help you with these
also.

### Does the plan cover general consultancy?

Support **cannot** be used:

- for general consulting,
- for brainstorming,
- for development of new features or plugins.

However, we can offer a consultancy bundle alongside the support contract. Get in touch for more information.

### What other benefits does a support plan give me?

On [our Discord chat](http://discord.gg/graphile), members are given coloured
name badges if they support our open source endeavours in some way (sponsorship, support
plan, etc). Unofficially, we can allocate more time to helping these
members with coloured name badges.
